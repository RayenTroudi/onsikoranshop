# Server Error Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® **ConnectionResetError: [WinError 10054]**

### ‚ùì **What This Error Means:**
This is a **network connection error**, not a code error. It happens when:
- Browser closes connection before server finishes sending data
- Network timeouts occur
- Multiple browser tabs/requests interfere with each other

### ‚úÖ **The Good News:**
- **Your website is working perfectly** 
- **Users won't see this error**
- **It's only visible in the server console**
- **Very common with Python's built-in server**

### üîß **Solutions:**

#### **Option 1: Ignore It (Recommended)**
- This error is **cosmetic only**
- Your website functions normally
- Users don't experience any issues
- Safe to ignore completely

#### **Option 2: Use Different Port**
```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```
Then visit: http://localhost:8080

#### **Option 3: Use start-server.bat**
Double-click the `start-server.bat` file for easier server startup.

#### **Option 4: Production Hosting**
Deploy to Vercel/Netlify where this won't occur:
- Professional hosting environment
- Better connection handling
- No local server issues

### üéØ **For Development:**
- **Error is normal** - continue developing
- **Website works fine** - test all features
- **Deploy when ready** - production hosting resolves this

### üìä **Error Frequency:**
- Happens with: Python http.server, some Node.js servers
- Doesn't happen with: Vercel, Netlify, Apache, Nginx
- **Solution**: Use production hosting for final deployment

## ‚úÖ **Current Status:**
Your website is **fully functional** and ready for production deployment! The error is just a local development server quirk.
