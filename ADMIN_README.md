### Security Notes
- Demo authentication (replace with real auth system)
- Client-side only (integrate with backend APIs)
- Input validation and sanitization recommended

## Integration with Backend

To connect with a real backend API:

1. **Replace the demo authentication** in `handleLogin()` method
2. **Update CRUD operations** to make actual API calls instead of local array manipulation
3. **Implement file upload** for product images
4. **Add error handling** for network requests
5. **Implement real-time updates** with WebSockets or polling

### API Endpoints (Example)
```javascript
// Products
GET    /api/products          # Get all products
POST   /api/products          # Create product
PUT    /api/products/:id      # Update product
DELETE /api/products/:id      # Delete product

// Orders
GET    /api/orders            # Get all orders
GET    /api/orders/:id        # Get order details

// Auth
POST   /api/auth/login        # Admin login
POST   /api/auth/logout       # Admin logout
```

## Customization

### Adding New Fields
1. Update the product form HTML in `admin.html`
2. Modify the `saveProduct()` method in `admin-script.js`
