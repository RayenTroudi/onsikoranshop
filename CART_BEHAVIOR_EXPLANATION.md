# Cart Behavior Explanation

## 🛒 Current Cart Behavior (Normal E-commerce Behavior)

The cart **automatically saves items to localStorage** so that:
- ✅ Items persist when you refresh the page
- ✅ Items persist when you close/reopen the browser
- ✅ Users don't lose their cart contents accidentally

This is **standard e-commerce behavior** - most shopping sites work this way.

## 🔍 What You Observed

When you see "items automatically added" on page load, it's actually:
1. **Loading saved items** from localStorage
2. **Not adding new items** - just restoring what was already there

## 🧹 To Clear Cart (If Needed)

If you want to start fresh, run this in browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('cart')
location.reload()
```

Or add this function to your code for easy clearing:
```javascript
function clearCart() {
    state.items = [];
    localStorage.removeItem('cart');
    renderCart();
}
```

## ⚙️ Alternative Behaviors (If Desired)

**Option 1: Clear cart on every page load**
```javascript
// Add this to loadCart() function
localStorage.removeItem('cart'); // Always start fresh
```

**Option 2: Clear cart after X hours**
```javascript
// Add timestamp to cart saving
const cartData = {
    items: state.items,
    timestamp: Date.now()
};
localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(cartData));
```

**Option 3: Session-only cart (clears when browser closes)**
```javascript
// Use sessionStorage instead of localStorage
sessionStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(state.items));
```

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Cart functionality is working correctly**
✅ **Items persist between sessions (normal behavior)**
✅ **No bugs detected - this is expected e-commerce behavior**

The debug scripts have been removed and console logging cleaned up.
